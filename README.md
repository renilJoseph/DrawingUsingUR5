# DrawingUsingUR5

# Install

use pip to install python package (https://github.com/SintefManufacturing/python-urx):
```
pip install urx
```

Check the orientation.gif file, which contains the way the board and UR5 needs to be positioned. Based on our UR5, the positive y axis is the direction in which the white wire goes out as you can see in the orientation.gif file.

# RUN
```
python simple.py ABC
```

I will update the sample code, meanwhile please message for any help.
